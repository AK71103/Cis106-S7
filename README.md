Session 7 Assignment Problems – Looping Logic 2 and Reading Data from the Keyboard and Files
For each problem prepare an IPO chart. Then write the code for each. Save the IPO within this document
and upload to your repository. After code is complete upload the files (.py) to your repository. Paste the
link to your repository into the assignment completion link in Blackboard.
1. Allow the user to enter a principle amount and interest rate repeatedly (need a loop to control
the program execution). Compute the annual interest (principle x rate). Compute ending
balance to be principle (beginning balance + interest). Display year, beginning balance and
ending balance for each of the 5 years. Display the accumulated interest for the 5 years. Note:
the new balance by year (this will be the principle for the following year. Format the output.
Example:
Enter principle amount: 10000.00
Enter interest rate: 0.10
Year Beginning Ending
Balance Balance
1 $10,000.00 $11,000.00
2 $11,000.00 $12,100.00
3 $12,100.00 $13,310.00
4 $13,310.00 $14,641.00
5 $14,641.00 $16,105.00
Total interest earned: $6,156.00

2. Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of natural order. The sequence is:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 etc
Use of for loop compute and display first 20 numbers in the sequence. Hint: start with 1 , 1.

3. Create a text file that contains employee last name and salary. Read in this data. Determine the
bonus rate based on the chart below. Use that rate to compute bonus. For each line display the
employee last name, salary and bonus. After the loop display the sum of all bonuses paid out.
Salary Bonus Rate
100,000.00 and up 20%
50,000.00 15%
All other salaries 10%
Example data file (create your own data with at least 5 lines):
Adams
50000.00
Baker
75000.00
Smith
45000.00

   4. Create a text file with item, quantity and price. Read through the file one line at a time.
Compute the extended price (quantity x price). For each line display the item, quantity, price
and extended price. After the loop display the sum of all the extended prices, the count of the
number of orders and the average order.
Example Data File:
Widget
10
50
Hammer
2
10
Saw
4
8
Etc.

5. Create a text file with student last name, district code (I or O) and number of credits taken.
Compute tuition owed (credits taken x cost per credit). Cost per credit for in district students
(district code I) is 250.00. Out of district students pay 500.00 per credit. For each line display
student last name, credits taken and tuition owed. After the loop display sum of all tuition owed
and the number of students.
Example file:
Jones
I
12
Adams
I
10
Baker
O
12
Smith
O
16
Etc
